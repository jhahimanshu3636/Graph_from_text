Managed accommodation provider Stanza Living has raised Rs 110 crore ($13 million) in what appears to be a bridge round led by Alpha Wave. The equity round is coming after a gap of more than three years for the Delhi-based startup.

The board at Stanza Living has passed a special resolution to issue 1,207 preference shares at a price of Rs 911440.17 each to raise Rs 110 crore, its regulatory filing accessed from the Registrar of Companies shows.

Alpha Wave has pumped in Rs 83 Crore while Matrix Partners, Accel India and Peak XV invested Rs 27 crore cumulatively.

As per startup data intelligence platform TheKredible, Stanza Living was valued at around Rs 3,900 crore ($470 million). This is a marginal jump in valuation from Rs 3,525 crore ($424 million) in the last equity round.

The firm was reportedly in talks to raise funding to the tune of $25 million.

Stanza Living had raised $57 million in a debt round led by Kotak Mahindra Bank and RBL Bank in March 2022 and $100 million in an equity round in April 2021. So far, it has scooped up over $230 million across equity and debt rounds.

Stanza Living is a managed accommodation platform which provides co-living solutions for working professionals and students. The firm claims to have an inventory of more than 75,000 beds in 450 plus residences with a presence across 24 cities.

Stanza Living’s revenue from operations surged to Rs 442 crore in FY23 from Rs 115 crore in FY22. As per TheKredible, its losses increased by 18.71% to Rs 495 crore in FY23 as compared to Rs 417 crore in FY22. The firm is yet to file its audited financial statements for FY24. 

Stanza Living competes with Colive, Your Space, Settl, Union Living and Coho. Last year, Tiger Global-backed home rental startup NestAway was acquired by Aurum PropTech (formerly Majesco Ltd) in a 90% haircut in valuation to $11 million.


Propelld, an education-focused lending platform, has secured $25 million debt funding for its wholly-owned NBFC subsidiary Edgro.

Edgro has raised the amount from nine lenders such as Credit Saison India Private Limited, AU Small Finance Bank, InCred Financial Services Limited and Northern Arc Capital Limited.

The company will utilize the funds to boost its reach and offerings.

Founded in 2019 by Bibhu Prasad Das, Victor Senapaty and Brijesh Samantaray, Propelld offers education loan financing solutions through Study Now and Pay Later products as well as Income Sharing Agreements (ISA) via the NBFC arm. The company also introduced collateral-free education financing.

The platform targets tier II and III cities where students face difficulties in securing finances from accredited lenders.

While Edgro started its operations in July 2023, Propelld has already raised nearly $40 million from the likes of WestBridge Capital, Stellaris Venture Partners and India Quotient to date. Its last fundraise worth $35 million materialized in February 2022.

As of the last funding round, Propelld had an annual loan disbursal run rate of Rs 600 crore.

Propelld registered a more than two fold jump in its operating revenue to Rs 75 crore in FY23 from Rs 33 crore in FY22.  As per startup data intelligence platform TheKredible, the firm’s losses also surged over 4X to Rs 26.72 crore in FY23 from Rs 5.96 crore in the previous year.

Propelld competes with the likes of Leap Finance, Financepeer, GrayQuest, Eduvanz, Auxilo, MPower Financing and Credenc. Interestingly, all these players cornered decent funding in the past three years. Leap Finance raised $75 million in June 2022 while Credenc raised $25 million from Capital India in July 2021. In December 2022, Eduvanz raised $12 million whereas GrayQuest and Mpower Finance scored $7 million and $150 million respectively in 2023. Earlier this year, Auxilo also raised $6 million in debt.
